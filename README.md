# Web Dev Group Finder

Allows developers of all skill levels to find a group/project to work on to show their skills, and strengthen them. We wanted to build a platform where people could find the people with the skills to get the job done. Most starter to intermediate developers would benefit from outsourcing for certain areas in order to get your product online faster.

Not being able to deploy your project because you are running into bugs or cannot set up a data base can waste a lot of time. If you take too long in the development stage your technology can become outdated or worse, someone could beat you to your target market. With Web Dev Group Finder, you can make sure you meet or beat your deadline every time.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer who has some coding experience,
I WANT a platform that finds people with a certain skill-set
SO THAT I can get my project deployed faster
```

## Challenges With This Project

    * One of the most difficult parts of this project was retrieving information from our database and distributing it to the necessary pages.
    
    * As with every group project, there are going to be merge conflicts and strange branching issues.


## Favorite Parts of the Project

    * Learning about databases and the way that they function and send information where it is requested.

## What We Would Like to Add in the Future

    * Multi-lingual platform not only on the site but as an option on the user profile. There are a lot of people who could benefit from the ability to find other programmers who speak an uncommon dialect.

    * The coding languages that we selected are widely used but they are far from covering everything you may need with regards to code. Adding heaps more languages would draw in more users.
